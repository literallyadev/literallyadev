- 👋 Hi, I’m @literallyadev, a dev apprentice at an international company in 🇩🇪
- 👀 I’m interested in improving my front end skills, since I really enjoy front end and getting a better grasp on back end.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS, VB, and Python 
- 💞️ I’m collaborating on a text game with my partner ❤️
- 👩‍👦 I've got a beautiful son, am finishing up my last year of 📖 school 📚, and enjoy a lot of hobbies that don't involve coding, such as gaming, being active, photography, and drawing.
